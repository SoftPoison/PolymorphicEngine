# Simple Polymorphic Engine

This is a proof of concept to demonstrate how polymorphic code can use self-modification to hide its inner workings.

## Requirements:

- gcc
- nm
- gdb

## How to build:

1. Run `make dependencies` to generate the dependencies
2. Edit `poly.c` however you desire
3. Run `make` to build the final product
